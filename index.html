                              <p>Brainstorming ideas:
                                Seating according to stop
                                An app that inputs your stop and if someone's stop is next you have to give up your seat to someone else
                                Since there stop is next giving up their seat would be easier to lower crowding
                                The only people sitting down are the ones with later stops
                                Self driving bus/train
                                Uses the same type of technology used for tesla cars
                                Since its at a much larger scale and more people are on board some tweaks would have to be made to the auto drive technology to ensure safety
                                Can always be switched to manual driving
                                Alerted stop
                                App that alerts a passenger when to get off their stop
                                Helps any older or sleeping passengers on public transportation
                                Uses the maps app to calculate the stop inputted into the app so that it alerts the passenger better
                                Pole extensions
                                The normal poles for buses and trains aren’t always good and sometimes aren’t comfortable when its crowded
                                The new pole can extend with a button, the pole that comes out can be adjusted for a person of any height and has a triangle shaped handle for comfortability
                                USB on trains
                                Just like they have on buses only on trains now
                                For people that have to charge their electronics
                                Sensors on train doors
                                Instead of the train conductor having to control the doors after opening the doors sensors will be able to notice if someone is trying to get in or out
                                Sometimes passengers make it to the train but the doors close, the person would be able to stick their hand in or out(depending on if they are leaving or entering) to stop the doors before it touches them
                                Normally the door has to slightly close on your arm until the train conductor of the cart notices
                                If an item blocks the door someone could just move it aside
                                Pressure plates
                                To stop suicides and fatalities there will be pressure plates will be in between the train tracks and will be alerted if someone is on it notifying the coming train
                                A person can then safely go down and help the person below
                                The pressure plate will only detect a certain amount of weight so no rodents can cause any delays for trains
                                Barrier
                                These will be put in front of the doors of the bus and will be automatically opened so that no one can open it
                                This will not only protect people from falling in but also from dropping their belongings
                                Digital map with gps for trains
                                Just like the bus already has the train since it's already having more screens installed as of today in the future there could be a digital map installed having a gps signaling any stops
                                Wheelchair ramp automated by Bus Driver
                                Every time a wheel chaired passenger boards the bus driver must just of the chair to put out the ramp and lower the bus
                                Having it being automated makes it not only faster but easier for both sides
                                Bus clock
                                Just like how the trains have them in their carts buses should also have a clock inside of them.
